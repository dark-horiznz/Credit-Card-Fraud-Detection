<h2>Description :</h2><br>
This is a detailed application of various ML classification algorithms and their performance on a higly imbalanced dataset consisting on < 0.05% cases of fraud. I have also utilised syntetic data generation techniques such as SMOTE to address this imbalance. <br>
I have also compared and presented previous research work on this problem as well a detailed analysis of my approach and its results in a seperate report.
